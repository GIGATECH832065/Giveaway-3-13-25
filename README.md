Technical Sheet: deathstar.js - 3D Schematic Death Star
Idea
•	Create a 3D wireframe schematic of the Death Star using Three.js for a website giveaway splash page.
•	Features a rotating wireframe sphere with a superlaser dish and surface panel lines, rendered in neon cyan and magenta.
Skills Used
•	JavaScript: Dynamic 3D rendering, animation loops, event handling.
•	Custom Three.js: Scene setup, geometry creation (sphere, cylinder, custom buffer), wireframe materials, lighting.
•	3D Graphics: Coordinate systems, transformations, wireframe visualization.
•	Web Development: DOM integration, CDN usage.
•	Mathematics: Spherical coordinates, trigonometry for vertex placement.
•	Design: Neon color palette, schematic aesthetic balance.
